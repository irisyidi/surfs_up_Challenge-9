## Overview of the statistical analysis 

The objective of the statistical analysis is to evaluate the temperature trends before opening the surf shop so that whether the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round can  be evaluated and properly predicted. 


## Results 
### Key Differneces in Whether between June and December 

The results for statistics for June and December are shown below. Five major differences in weather between June and December are discovered through the summary statistics.

- The temperature is overall lower in December than that in June

The lowest temperature in December is 56 which is 8 lower than that in June even though the highest temperature in December is 83, which is 2 lower than that in June. Through the comparison of quartiles, approximately 50% daily temperatures are between 56 an 71 in December while 50% daily temperatures are between 64 and 75. Therefore, the temperature in December is overall higher than that in June. 

- June’s average temperature is slightly higher than that in December 

The mean of June’s temperature is 74.94 while the mean of December’s temperature is 71.04 which is 3.9 lower than that in June. 

- December’s temperatures present more volatile 

The standard deviation of June’s temperature is 3.25 and the standard deviation of December’s temperature is 3.75 which is 0.5 higher than that in June. The higher standard deviation means temperatures in December are more likely to fluctuate. Besides, temperatures in June changes between 64 and 85 while temperatures in December varies between 56 and 83. Therefore, temperatures in December fluctuate more apparently than those in June. 


## Summary 
### Summary of Results 
Through comparison of statistical summary of December and June, opening shop is preferred to be set in June because the temperature in June is higher and more stable than that in December. Higher temperature and narrowed changes in temperatures means high demand for surf and the higher possibilities of good weathers and large customer volumes. Therefore, it is more likely for new business to maintain the operations and get success. 


### Two Additional Queries 
- the Statistical Summary of Precipitation

As precipitation is important factor for surf, it is recommended that the statistical summary of precipitation be analyzed to make comparison of the rainfall and determine when to open the shop.

- the Statistical Summary of Stations 

As the number of stations means the accessibility of places of the store, the analysis of the locations and the number of stations can be made to settle the most convenient place for customer to get access to surfing.
